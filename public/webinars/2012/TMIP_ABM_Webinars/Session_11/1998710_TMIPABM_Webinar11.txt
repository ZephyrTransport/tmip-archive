Please stand by for realtime captions. 
>> Welcome everyone, my name is John -- [Indiscernable Name], this is on activity-based modeling in this is the 11th session entitled network integration. 
>> To provide the best possible audio experience try to abide -- ovoid feedback -- avoid background noise and feedback. At the end of the webinar we will post a questionnaire and we are interested in your feedback and how to improve search -- future webinars. 
>> The pull determine format and webinar topics. 
>> We will take a one minute rake before the final question and answer section to allow you to fill out the evaluation Paul -- Paul -- poll. 
>> This is scheduled for two and half hours then we will have an hour presentation and then 5 to 15 minutes for questions and answers, then this is followed by a second one hour presentation and at the end of the second half there will be two minutes reserved for you to fill out the evaluation Paul and then we will spend the remaining time answering your questions. 
>> You can ask any questions via the webinar software. There will be a question-and-answer window that will appear on your screen and you can type your questions there. We are recording the webinar and will make it available online within two weeks. 
>> Finally I should mention that we are trying something new, closed captioning for the hearing impaired. If this works well we intend to post fees on a YouTube site. Consequently the layout will look different in the past because there is a new closed captioning pod under the slide presentation. If you do not want to see the closed captioning then hit the button for the full-screen mode in the lower right portion of the screen where the presentation screen. 
>> Without further ado I would like to introduce the speakers, the first speaker will be Joe Castilione and the second half speaker will be Peter Vovsha a part since -- Parsons. 
>> Without further do I would like to turn over to Joe. 
>> This is Joe I am a consultant with the research group in San Diego California and what I want to first talk about to you today and let me advance the slides is that we need to acknowledge the collaborative efforts. 
>> We are not presenting today in there are a lot of people that are providing content in helping to deliver this presentation. 
>> This is the 11th out of 12 in the series, and the next session is coming up just a few the -- weeks. 
>> Before we get into the main body of the discussion in addition to thanking you for joining us today I want to talk to you a bit about the learning outcomes and hopes for this session are. 
>> In today's session what we will be covering is the different means of integrating activity needs to -- models and we are hoping that at the end of the session people will be able to answer the following questions about activity is network integration. What do we mean when we talk about in the Gratian -- network integration and why is it important?  We will talk about how network integration is achieved. Also the difference with network integration when working with activity-based models as opposed to more trip based models. 
>> A key aspect will be what are the benefits going with network integration as well as what are the costs and challenges associated with integrating activity models? 
>>  And finally, what are the emerging practices that are coming out? 
>> What do we mean when we talk about network integration?
>>  There are two senses that we usethis,, first, it refers to a condition or an outcome [Please standby, technical difficulties, resetting captions]
>> Equilibrium really applies to increase travel efforts by shifting it to a new path. We refer to this a little more generally as the ability to achieve those. 
>> We will talk in more detail about each of these key terms. 
>> When we talk about demand models we are talking about a set of tools that are used to generate the type, amount, locations, and timing of travel. As I said a moment ago that this refers to the moment of travel that is determined by the first three steps of the model and they are generated by an activity-based model. 
>> They come in all sorts of flavors and they can be super basic such as the cost -- cross classification or extremely complex like interactivity coordination models. 
>> When we talk about it demand model we are not talking about a single model, we are talking about a series of components that we collectively referred to. For example this is a subcomponent that works for distribution models and also exists in coordination with separate mode choices. 
>> All of these models are executed within a sequence in overall demand model. 
>> It should be noted that these can be applied to all sorts of levels, such as zones, as is the case in most. Or they can be applied with individual persons or households like inactivity models. 
>> The critical input to demand models are measures of transportation and supply, availability, transportation system performance that is derived from the supply model, in addition, or other sushi or demographic things that are critical to input. 
>> The network performance measures are critical. 
>> In some cases these are used directly in the demand model component. 
>> In other cases they may be incorporated as accessibility measures that are used in directly. 
>> The network supply models are tools that are used to generate system network performance like ingested travel times. Like the demand model, supply models can be pretty basic such as an aggregate model or complex like a dynamic assessment were microsimulation -- were microsimulation. 
>> The supply models in order to produce levels of performance require input and information on travel commands -- demands. 
>> These estimates are applied to the estimates addition of network structure. They sometimes incorporate more network attributes that could be used to predict the path for the network. 
>> In the case of traditional static assignments that are used for forced up models, mathematical functions are used to estimate suggested travel times. 
>> It should be noted that because travelers choices are important not over -- not only by time but also by cost, it is configured to convert things for path building. 
>> We talk about feedback, what we are talking about is the process through with information that is generated lower in the model system such as congested travel time, is used as indirect or direct feedback. 
>> Feedback is important not just in working with activity based, but also when working with traditional trip based models to ensure that the final output is consistent with function. 
>> The exact nature of this feedback is related to the structure of the model. 
>> For example, if it uses accessibility in measures that reflect performance, then it should be fed back to the top of the models to update these before running a specific model. 
>> If there is no network performance indicators or trip generation and distribution, then it may only be necessary to feedback to network estimation. 
>> Convergence is a concept that is applicable to traditional systems and activity-based systems. 
>> It is necessary to ensure the behavioral integrity and ensure that the results will be useful. The level of service that is used as the basis for all the accessibility and key inputs components could be approximately equal to the times and cost that is produced. 
>> In a travel model system there is two types of convergence, one is network convergence, just the assignment side, and also overall model of convergence which is between the primary demand and supply. 
>> When we talk about convergence we are specifically talking about convergence to a solution. 
>> This typically means it is for some sort of equilibrium condition where for each time period, origin, and destination, they all have equal travel times. As you know it is iterated until we achieve a predetermined level of convergence. 
>> The overall model contributes, and it should be noted that in the context of integrated demands and an essential precondition, whether working with trip based or activity-based, an essential precondition for pursuing the overall model system convergence is establishing this in the process. 
>> I want to talk a little bit about why he network integration and the thoughtful consideration of this being so important. 
>> Proper integration is critical in trip based systems as well as inactivity based because in both types of model systems, there are demand models and supply models and they are mutually dependent. The demands generates information about origin and destination in part based on transportation indicators. 
>> The information generated is then used in the supply model and it's a science the travel demand to networks and generates things on the network performance. There is a back and forth between these two primary components and the consistency and feedback between the demand and supply components in the model system is really essential to ensure that the model system is useful. 
>> For example, if you attempt to address the impact of road pricing strategy for congestion relief, it will be misleading if the model system does not accurately represent or capture the location and timing of these delays. They arise from individual travel choices from the demand model as well as the network performance that our rises and as predicted by the supply model. 
>> I describe the supply model and demand model as both being tools, but overall they comprise the forecasting systems that we are work with and the systems themselves are tools that we try to use to measure the impact, whether it is impact on travel choices or network performance, or a different policy and investment choice. It is really important whether you are talking about the context of trip Easter activity based, that the model produces repeatable results within some acceptable range. The tool could be to reproduce but it would essentially be useless because he would be the same set of inputs and you get two different answers and how would you know which one to use. 
>> Activity-based models are typically implemented using simulation techniques which can produce slight variations in outcomes, but as prior webinars have described, most activity-based models incorporate features a significantly attenuate any of these. 
>> We want to avoid using a model system that produces things that are sufficiently different and provide different outcomes. 
>> Is important that the models produce repeatable results, but also that they are used to compare alternative scenarios. The differences in the output reflect to -- true differences about the model structure. If model output differences reflect issues with implementation rather than the differences between scenarios, the tool will not be useful. 
>> We want to avoid using a model system that is dependent on the specifics of a network starting position as this can get in the way of producing repeatable results. 
>> We also want to avoid using a model system where it off late between different outcomes. 
>> A key aspect is to have all of these that are useful. 
>> Everything in confidence will not be used our ability to produce repeatable unstable result is influenced by the resolution in the demand model. 
>> It is very crucial, it is difficult to get believable results if you have not properly integrated your results. 
>> One of the key aspects is that we want to be thoughtful with our choices across the different components. 
>> When forecasting emerged the practitioner is about how her to say size and facility. 
>> These days decision-makers really rely on travel demand models the answer to more complex problems and have the expectation that the models that we are using are going to be appropriately sensitive to the complex behavioral responses and policies. 
>> If you are adding capacity to a roadway segment, we know it it will result in the Thai version of traffic from a more congested route to, as people seek to reduce, it might also have the effectively demand due to existing congestion. 
>> Tools are applied at the particular time of day at a particular facility and it will influence not only the use of specific routes to which tools are applied, but it might also influence the timing of that travel. 
>> Depending on the nature of the scenario people might use different destinations to avoid tools and hire Lee or forgo making it a trip entirely. 
>> The complex policy questions are not strictly limited to transfers -- transportation investment, decision-makers want trouble models that are appropriately sensitive to say with the effects of compact and mixed-use. 
>> They want travel demand forecasting models that demand management strategies. 
>> Of course, ideally, they also want models that can tell them who is really being impacted by all of the transportation? 
>> Activity-based models integrated in a thoughtful manner with supply models provide more capability than traditional models. 
>> The complex questions necessitate a that they consistently capture the relationships between travel demand and supply. 
>> If network pricing is going to change by time of day then ideally network information is provided or generated with the pricing scenario. 
>> It is also fed back into the activity-based demand model. 
>> In predicting demand it reflects the fact that we can carry it into the configuration of the supply model. 
>> The difference between some man -- demand and supply is the issue of spatial constraint and activity-based models contain in trends that can logic that already constrains and makes individual choices logical. 
>> If members of houses that do not own cars are not allowed to use -- [Indiscernable-low volume]. 
>> For the activity-based model travelers are not allowed to say the destination of their term -- trip, and the timing has to be consistent. 
>> Ideally, the supply components can be coded in such a way that it is very consistent. 
>> After a certain time it shouldn't be considered as an alternative. The transit network processing should discourage extreme behavior. 
>> Maintaining budget is not a primary challenge. We mention it here because specifically as the network supply model involves and incorporates increasing levels of behavior on spatial detail, like the nature of trips on it to her, these issues may be more pronounced. 
>> We have a bridge expansion example that has been described in some of the prior webinars. I'm going to bring up all these slides to understand the impact and importance of network integration. For this scenario we consider the alternatives. 
>> There is no poles, the transit is flat, and the various alternatives and has been cut -- expanded to six lanes. Two of them are HOV lanes all day and other alternatives they are HOV only during peak periods, there is a new toll, in other scenarios that poll will vary -- poll -- toll will vary depending on time of day, I the scenarios their regional transit fares higher during peak.. 
>> I key question would be how would the analysis be impacted?
>>  In some of the previous webinars you have seen the long-term mobility affects and the potential long term and medium might mean things like change or -- changing in usual school the Haitian or vehicle ownership, or the number of types of vehicles owned. 
>> I want to talk to a little bit more about today and some of the shorter-term responses that we would expect travelers to have. 
>> In response to did different levels of congestion and cost, travelers may choose new locations for discretionary purposes, like shopping, or personal business to avoid bridge crossing if it will subject them to an additional poll -- toll, or conversely they may choose to take a bridge crossing that they would not have before because of HOV lanes that were there before or were not there before. 
>> If a toll or transit fare or availability  of HOV lane carries by time of day they may take it down a job or a void difference in travel times and cost by time of day. 
>> Similarly the differences in times and cost may cause travelers to change without. 
>> In other cases it might mean existing bridge users have shifted.
>> This really depends on the network supply components. 
>> What are the integration issues that we would want to think about? 
>> In order to ensure that the model is appropriately sensitive to the various alternative configurations, careful consideration needs to be given to supply model components. On the demand model side, this incorporates accessibility measures. 
>> It is activity generation and all of these measures are sensitive to changes in accessibility by time of day and reflective of all of those. 
>> Given the fundamental aspects and the variations in mode of availability, whether it to be is available or not, the demand model should incorporate a time of day resolution to represent the policies and network performance changes that can be provided. 
>> It has to be able to determine between SUV and HOV given the different networks are available. And different measures will arise by having high occupancy vehicle lanes. 
>> We might include toll models. 
>> It is also good a cold that it includes a behavioral resolution that reflects the different polls and fares depending on who the traveler is and a whole range of other attributes. 
>> And thinking about the supply side, the transit networks will incorporate different things unless you explicitly recommend that. 
>> As well as recommendations about network changing cost during time of day. 
>> Consistency with policies that will be evaluated, will the tools are fares vary only by a broad multi-our time., Or will they dare he -- or will they vary? 
>> Transit networks need to be coded to reflect a true double of service -- true level of service. 
>> To provide relevant information back to the demand model it is essential to ensure that the network assignment captures and reflects these variations by time of day and the other modes. 
>> You need to give careful consideration to the to manned -- demand and supply model. 
>> What specific information is the exchange between the demand and supply model component?  How are the components interacting in a feedback framework in order to ensure consistent and usable results. 
>> It is specifically segmented by mode and time of day. 
>> The supply model needs to provide information about network conformance -- performance. 
>> As we discussed, when considering how to achieve its we need to consider these three elements. 
>> The supply model using dynamic or static methods and the connectors. What information is being exchanged, and how is it being exchanged?  We also need to consider the question of convergence. 
>> Here we have a typical relationship in this model and I would note that this figure is really relevant regardless of whether it to the fans -- the demand is typical or aggregate. 
>> The principles are truly the same. There is specifics where we get into the details. 
>> The demand model uses travel time and trouble cost information that shows network performance. In addition to other attributes of Coors light -- of course like income, occupation. 
>> Network supply model takes this and applies it to transit networks to develop estimates of cost and time. 
>> This new cost information is used to develop new revised estimates. 
>> The convergence of the model system to a stable solution is used to assess at a system level. 
>> The process to terminate this and if it is not met then the demand and supply models are run again. 
>> The principle that we is applying -- we are applying is the same whether you're talking about activity based toward traditional model -- or a traditional model. 
>> What distinguishes the activity based from trip based is activity involves more toys and these are additional components that comprise the activity based components and the tie is an amount of detailed information that is exchanged between supply and demand is more complex. 
>> While there are a number of similarities that we will talk about more in successive slides, for example -- [Indiscernable-low volume]. 
>> They typically incorporate more in some of these components provide more detailed sensitivity. Some in incorporate the think models as well as a separate model. 
>> Other components provide sensitivity and traced dimensions that are not typically embed it. Activity-based models also are more complex. 
>> They can explicitly incorporate more information about constraint such as the tie models that are available or the maximum distance that can be traveled within a time window. 
>> Activity-based employees more levels of detail using individual people or households as decision-makers and representing time in small slices, or continuously. 
>> The fine-grained behavior all and be asked Pless -- it requires it to be linked to do the demand and supply model components. 
>> There are two main linkages, one is the handoff of demand from the activity-based model system to the network assignment model or network supply model, and the other is the information exchange, the linkage from the supply model back to the activity-based demand model. 
>> I will talk about the first linkage from the demand model to the supply model and then I will turn the presentation over to Peter who will talk about the second half of the linkage. 
>> Here we see a chart that shows the parallel structures of the trip based and activity-based. 
>> You can see the primary components of a traditional print-based -- trip based their generation, distribution, they all have analogs. Instead of the trip generation you have activity generation, incentive trip distribution you have destination choices. And you actually have a time of day choice model. 
>> The first demand to supply model, as in the trip based system, the primary thing is to really think about how we exchange this information. 
>> How do we do that?
>>  This is where we get into market segmentation. 
>> It is critical and the timing of the handoff from the supply to the demand, as well as properly feeding information back. 
>> Market segmentation refers to the treatment of the overall travel market that is comprised of smaller markets that are differentiated up by key attributes. 
>> Referring back to the bridge example, we can consider it the transit segment to -- segment. 
>> It is distinct from the auto segment, they drive alone or share a ride. 
>> We want to treat these two markets separately, we want to allow them to use the best available to you and prevent them from driving. 
>> Conversely, we want to make sure that no travelers and abusing transit based. 
>> In this example the demand model is predicting the mode that a traveler uses. 
>> This is a basic way of thinking about market segmentation, but it does not apply to mode of choice. 
>> It extends to many other choice dimensions as well like time of day or purpose. 
>> From a network integration perspective, one of the key advantages is that it would be allowed is tremendous flexibility in terms of market segment within the component itself and the network supply model. 
>> In the trip based model system we have less flexibility primarily due to the fact that as we increase the number of market segments there is a common as fact -- calming effect that requires multiple matrices and how we can get different a man's -- demands that are relevant on both supply and demand. 
>> It can be mode, time of day, value of time, etc. 
>> What is different?,  If you -- what is different? If you participated in some of the other webinars, activity-based models have decided advantages and they are produced by traditional models, in traditional you would produce after every step and then it becomes the matrix that is further segmented. 
>> In contrast to these computational challenges the result in increased market segmentation, activity-based models are much more flexible due to what we call the list-based model. 
>> One is a list of trips and this contains all of the details, spatial, temporal, behavioral, so she are demographic information -- so she oh demographic -- sociodemo, this is an advantage that you have a most network supply model software requires this by mode and time of day. 
>> The detailed information is contained in this demand model and it can really be aggregated to any market. 
>> If they wanted to transition from three hours to one hours or a context of pricing analysis, they really only need to revise the aggregation process that comes at the very end of the simulation rather than making changes throughout. 
>> This kind of approach facilitates a flexible specification of different segments and the use of fine-grained segments in sure the consistency between demand and supply when integrated. 
>> To give you a few more illustrations about segmentation and why it is important, here is an example. 
>> Right now we are looking at highway market segmentation. Here is a global market for a time. Then it coordinates -- [Indiscernable-low volume]. 
>> Shared ride traveler is that can use a general-purpose lane or a toll lane or they can offer using HOV lane and may be eligible to use different ones. 
>> We treat these as different choices because they are associated with different time and cost measures. 
>> The drive alone pay alternative has a higher monetary cost the lower travel time, depending on the individual traveler and the decision-making process they may choose one of these nodes -- nodes -- modes. 
>> We want to think about this is a separate market segment, each toys is -- each toys -- choice is different, when we simulate this week and allow them to use pay or tool facilities allow us -- along with general. But we don't want to allow them to use HOV. 
>> Building on that we can look at the transit market segmentation. There is about 15 market segment alternatives and these are comprised of combinations of five primary transit nodes as well as free access -- three access modes. 
>> There is a local bus, light rail, commuter rail, and different access modes of walking, driving, or someone dropping you off. 
>> We treat these as separate choices in the demand model because they are associated with different time and cost measures and potentially availability. 
>> In establishing that integration we want to consider each of these as a separate market and assign these demands when generating the different availability and constraints. 
>> If it shows in the trip is walk access to light rail, when we assign that we want to make sure that we use light rail routes and potentially other routes that are used. 
>> But we want to restrict this from using commuter rail to exhibit the -- hierarchy. 
>> Many of the issues in integrating the demand to supply model handshake are similar to those based in the trip model context. 
>> The critical distinction is there are tremendous opportunities and flexibility in the context of activity-based. 
>> It really ensures consistency between these two primary components and the overall model system and insurers that we are pursuing getting a reasonable and realistic polls -- pulse. 
>> That concludes the first half of the data handshake, if there are questions on the first topic think we have an opportunity to respond to some of those. 
>> John and I will turn it over to you. 
>> We actually do not have any questions on the first half, we do encourage you to ask questions, it will be a lot of time it to ask questions after the second half. To keep us on schedule and provide as much opportunity at the end to ask questions, we are going to go ahead and turn it over to Peter. 
>> Are you ready to go? 
>>  Yes. Thank you for a good introduction and every one for your interest in advanced modeling. 
>> Let me see if I can move the slide. Basically what I would like to do you is take you to some level of additional technical details and specifically how the feedback in equilibrium between these models can be achieved. 
>> I also want to go over some recent research directions that we have found and consider promising. 
>> Basically we have started exploring many different directions for activity-based models and dynamic traffic assignment. 
>> This slide is a reminder that is something that is very important to keep in mind with the entire topic that we are discussing today. It is that activity-based models are very sensitive to the network level of service. 
>> It is not only destination node because they would be similar to the force that model -- a four step model. 
>> It is a complication but it has been designed this way specifically because in reality when we change networks and travel time and vice versa, it is because of growing congestion and we can consider tolls. It changes the behavior of people in many different ways. It starts with ownership and mobility and affect the way that people change activity patterns and generate different types of activities. It affects the destination mode and occupancy twice. It specifically access is how people might interact with each other and if we apply encouraging travel via HOV lanes. 
>> If you take a look at the time of day choice, you can imagine that to support a model like this, and we've previously talked about this at length, I hope that you have had a chance to attend this, but they remember that one big advantage is they can handle the time of day choice in a more comprehensive way. But they would have to fill it with detailed time specific variables. If we don't do this and try to combine the model with a simplified model, then actually we might have a complete miss in the it would work against us and produce strange results. 
>> The model expects a fine level of detail and if we don't provide it this way will not work. 
>> In general, before we go into technical different -- details I want to make an important statement that traveled the man's on the regional model are two sides of the same coin. Eventually to be able to evaluate or make decisions and compare the different projects and networks which is our bread and butter, we need a complete model, we need a complete integrated model that has both sides since there is level of details in place. 
>> The quality of the integrated auto, in my experience, is not the average, it's the minimum. It is the worst one actually. Basically it does not make much sense to have one component at a high level of detail and another component highly aggregated and simplified. 
>> What we have to do and what we are trying to do, is it a chunk of our ongoing efforts, we are talking about consultants in academia, we need to support detailed activity-based models and the reasonable network simulation and how we can integrate them to achieve this level of consistency. 
>> If we take a look at the current state of the practice we will probably find a lot of examples of simplified approaches, specifically on the network side if you take a look at the majority for model supplied for smaller urban areas and medium urban areas, there is many examples of simplification. It has an explanation and there is a lot of cases where one assignment or peak assignment would be applied in some assumptions are made and many have not been simulated.
>> Rarely they have a transit and assignment -- transit assignment. 
>> When we move to bigger metropolitan areas details of the transit come into play but a very few majority have a simplified approach to transit. 
>> Those things basically have an explanation of why things happen. 
>> When it comes to practices abusing activity-based models in large metropolitan areas, there are is a high level of detail and ideally we would like to have the time and resolution for the network model and supply model be consistent. 
>> Ideally if we have an activity-based model as we described before, the resolution should be there and we would like to bring them closer. Conceivably it presents problems and challenges, some are purely ethical because it generates a lot of level of service.
>> There are also some conceptual issues. There is an idea of using a dynamic traffic assignment and it is much better to think about the consistent dynamic traffic assignment rather than a set of large numbers of static assignment. 
>> More detailed assignment will pull out sensitivity, but there are also application policy implications that it takes urban left -- certain levels of detail. 
>> For example reversible lanes, variable tolls, or transit service opening and closing hours. You would like to have all of this properly reflected in your travel model. 
>> My recent experience working on the Manhattan pricing study in New York, we had to answer many questions that were formulated in a exact and detailed levels of close reading hours -- closing hours, would we start at 6 PM or is six erred he, -- 6:30 PM, that is a very important practical application, to be able to model this you would need to instruct the traffic consignment and have a high level of solution to be able to answer questions like this. 
>> For networks of large size the complexity of the network in the end of itself is a factor. 
>> To prepare these networks in a proper way it is time is taking -- takes a lot of time to say the least specifically, we have to see the level of service variables primarily the distribution choice in the configuration that has an efficient way to reach these. In some models they went ahead and integrated feedback for the generation, but if you make it sensitive to the service scheme then eat -- the four step model becomes almost as complicated. It is difficult to integrate. People primarily prefer fixed models because you know how it integrates with the entire system. 
>> With an activity-based model it really becomes more complex and holistic. The level of service changes with the time model system simultaneously. It affects everything, we specifically made this after and continue working in this direction with activity-based models to make them more sophisticated with the level of service. That is what you see right now on the screen, how it is implemented, everything is dependent on everything else. 
>> If you change the network it can affect the whole set of choices starting with long-term choices. I am not talking about activity patterns. At this point, as you understand, literally a fully integrated system. How can we implement this and support it with the data and make it efficient computationally? 
>>  This is something there we have made a lot of progress towards but there are still some challenges. 
>> Here are several examples of what happens when we try to use more advanced models, specifically all three models listed here are activity-based at different levels of complexity, all of them are advanced. 
>> You can see that the model was integrated with procedures by six time and date. It's -- six time of day time frames. 
>> They developed time of day frames and this is an example of one general tendency. This activity-based model makes us want more models on the network side and on this particular slide we are talking about the prevailing practice of still using static assignments. It is not yet a dynamic assignment, but you can still see that it is adding more details and it works with the level of resolution and that is probably the example for most of the models to follow unless we completely switch to a dynamic traffic assignment. 
>> This is big payday by the necessity to bring the network procedures to the same level of scale and accuracy as the model itself. 
>> There are also additional details that we have to take into account the -- I count -- account, they are primarily structured to determine better peak periods and the before and after peak. It talks about building up congestion in releasing congestion and many of you know this is a complicated process and it is very important but not always schematically in terms of travel time. We try to capture this explicitly by having shoulders and peak periods separate to -- separate. 
>> These models are also on the transit side. The model I deal he has to be integrated in the mood choice is extensive. The resolution on the highway side is simplified and would not work either. Transit has its own rules and complexity in terms of vacancies and ultimately what happens is we have to extend the assignment to the same extent that we do on the highway side. 
>> There is a motorized assignment leading into this. There are also many examples of multi-class assignments. If I use the Congo -- Chicago as an example of the various time classes to take into account that vehicles in the traffic assignment have to be distinguished not only by vehicle type and occupancy, but also by the willingness to play -- paid the presence of tolls. 
>> This is an example of the Chicago multi-class assignment is that right now. 
>> You can see the large number of classes, that function is to capture important differences in terms of vehicle type, time, occupancy, and between poll -- toll  and non-tran1 users. 
>> The future belongs to a structured multi-class assignment specifically for regions that consider polls. 
>> There are differences between different classes is an this becomes important and especially the focus of the policy itself. 
>> I would also like to share with you the technical observation, maybe it is not an easy slide to grasp, but it is important. The limitations and computations on all of this, the computations I do of the activity-based model and specifically in regard to using a different level of service is very different. In a sense it is more complicated, also we do have some additional solutions, the difference is that the trip-based models infinitely are metrics -- matrix taste structures -- based structures. 
>> Specifically for destination no choice, but also for other choices it is present. 
>> A typical computational schema of a four step model would look over origins of destination and then it would be implemented for each origin destination. 
>> They are basically happening at the same time, it is basically a single one in everything happens within this role, certain computations in cumulative split by notes and so forth by destination. It is a full calculation over origins destination. 
>> Activity-based models have a completely different structure. 
>> They don't loop over origins destination, there is not one component that will ever look like this. 
>> They are organized in terms of the actual code in a very different way. They look over millions of individual records rather than -- [Indiscernable-low volume]. 
>> It is comparable to the number of records and it might be less. This is a different look, and activity-based model has a different look, but it is not bigger than the look of the four step model. 
>> The differences what happens within this loop, we do not have a predetermined technical set of all to rations that we have to implement it. 
>> -- Implement. 
>> We can do this through an additional chain of choice where we need to select certain schemes and pairs randomly based on the outcome. 
>> There is no predetermined breeding of certain substitutions data. We need random access to different parts of the metrics. 
>> This is a major computation and it provides major challenges with the activity-based model because it results in great memory requirements and inefficient random acts which is not simple. 
>> There is also room for some pre-computations that were not possible. 
>> The use number of computations and searches that you have to do on the fly. 
>> That has to be understood, specifically when we discuss limpid patients -- limitations. 
>> It has to be understood why we cannot meet halfway and use this to support and activity-based model, we also want to make it efficient. 
>> There are certain input data sources that need to be taken into account, this is not simple. 
>> For example, activity-based models might require more detailed input. They would take advantage of it in terms of the time of day sensitivity networks. 
>> We have enough examples in the United States of changing HIV lane status, reversible lanes, variable road pricing, and variable transit service by time of day. 
>> To really take advantage of all of this we have to provide the sensitive networks. On the transit side if you really want to make a real estate it would require many different time of day., Probably eight or 10 like we have in Chicago. That is what you need to describe the transit in an urban area. 
>> Maintaining all of this might be a challenge in another itself. For this reason because it is difficult to maintain in smaller into walls -- smaller segments, there are certain networks. 
>> In some cases this might be better, but in some cases it's a syndication. 
>> On the high-tech side there are giants that are approaching the field in the first example is the productive deliberation, for example, in our recent research it is not to build networks from scratch as before we have to take it Vantage of the networks -- advantage of the networks and put them in assignable networks that we can use with travel mode. 
>> This is a lot of information, probably many of you I believe have experienced this, but those that have not, don't think the roadway network is simple, just like you can find in a textbook, notes and links. It is true that every road network is a combination of nodes and links, but there is a lot of information and data items that have to be attached to this. 
>> They have to be some way calculated computationally before we can start a network procedure. 
>> This is a science in and of itself and I will not go into details, but many of you know how long and difficult and complicated this might be. 
>> The same on the transit side, it is seemingly simple, we have transit routes and stops and segments, we have access links connected to the central way. It is very simple in., But to really prepare a good transit network for assignment scheming it is a long way to go and there is a lot of details. 
>> We won't talk about this today, but many of you know about this and specifically supports the activity-based models we only need transit networks with an unusual level of detail because activity-based detail specifically show the time of day and a high level of resolution. 
>> Any particular transit services in terms of our of operation and when they are going to stop, seven or eight, what is the difference between frequency? All of these details come into play very strongly need to be supported in networks apply. 
>> Eventually the basic configurations of networks and details needed for network procedures have to be supported by data and validation. 
>> This is not dramatically different from a four step auto, even if there is a good four step model in you probably want to have this eventually. You would probably do this at a lower level or a more aggregate level of special details. 
>> I would not do to the [Inaudible-unrecognizable terminology] level. 
>> We could do half hour resolution's or model that, the level of service games and the linked volumes with speeds and tines by time of day. We want to have good coverage with the different traffic counts and different surveys or it other data that would allow us to see our outcomes with the maximum level of special detail by vehicle class. 
>> The measures we want to take into account are similar there is nothing principally new, just more details and that of course includes the highway side and the transit side as well as parking, inventory, and utilization for both park-and-ride and other parking. 
>> There are certain additional details that I would like to share with you the a sickly based on the recent experience to take full advantage of microsimulation in terms of the tale geography and specifically -- detailed geography and it specifically affects the transit side activity-based model. 
>> Certain things need to be taken into account, for example, if we talk about drive access for park-and-ride, don't forget to in an activity-based model there are people at the park-and-ride the eventually have to go back home and take their cars from the parking lot. Everything has to be properly directions in the network. 
>> This is very important. 
>> We have to pay attention to the parking supply and how parking is coded. 
>> There are several ways it can be coded to support the noun -- advanced procedures. 
>> In some cases it is better to code park-and-ride facility as a separate traffic sound depending on what type of [Inaudible-unrecognizable terminology] you run. 
>> With the recent application of certain models of the finer level of special resolution, like micro analysis based on the virtual path, we need more details regarding the transit network and those details eventually result in what we call transit access point -- where each one is a physical scope and the location is a computation and programmatically connected to each microanalysis zone to collate detailed access time and that is how Sacramento and San Diego were, this level of detail, they don't usually use the code centered connectors anymore. 
>> They use actual detailed networks and microanalysis to evaluate the transit. 
>> Of course, when we talk about user equilibrium, we have to decide what type of equilibrium we want to consider, what is the convergence criteria?  For the network procedure itsells,, and for the -- it's self and for the time I'll system it sells if I quickly switch between two different models the first one is an installation and the second is a structure of a different model to present activity-based models used in practice. 
>> You can see the structures are different, I will not go into details, we discussed them before, but the core part is that we have many components of the model, it is not a four or five step, we literally have dozens of steps. 
>> It is all basically the level of service that penetrates all of them. Each time we go to the assignment page we have to go back and rerun all of those models and all of them -- [Indiscernable-low volume], not just one or two. 
>> There is a change in level of service. 
>> [Please standby, captioners transitioning] 
>>The travel demand model are not the only components of the system, there are many more models, auxiliary models, but they may be for some particular regions, very important. External traffic, any region is a closed system and some regions have a pretty significant component of external traffic. There are special markets which are not covered like airports or special events. The prevailing practice is all the components are relative in terms of the modeling technology in the sense that we have a set of normal and additional simplified models that would generate the trips to the core model prior to the time. We are working with several groups and their are more tightly integrated approaches. We tried to integrate external workers, people who come to the region looking for jobs and they are competing for the same jobs as the residence. In Phoenix the MAG model is where we integrated special participation for sporting events in individual daily patterns. Basically, there are some interesting things with respect to those models as well 
>> Getting closer to [indiscernible - heavy accent], the most advanced, the most promising direction, which is an integration of activity-based model and [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> This is very good, but most of the fabrication are not really [indiscernible - heavy accent], but rather into the category that we call [indiscernible - heavy accent], it has to be understood that integration with the demand modellike ABM , is different than postprocessing. Basically, you can try to -- the difference between postprocessing and integration, is those processing does not require any feedback, it is a one-way road from demand to supply. This partial integration is a useful exercise to learn more and resolve certain issues and prepare the necessary background for integration. The San Francisco model is a very good one. One of the biggest -- ever applied in the history of travel and it is based on the -- model. It is not really an integration 
>> Another interesting thing which we would -- we will not be talking about this at length, there is a very interesting research branch considering the behavior. Of learning and adaptation. If we think about the reality of how people respond to network changes with improvements or [indiscernible - heavy accent], how people respond to that. It is based on the expected travel times and people try to implement certain things based on prior experience. This erodes over time -- evolves over time area if I normally know tonight they've replaced or shopping and it normally takes me 20 minutes to drive and if it becomes more congested than it takes me 30 minutes, at some point in time, I will change my behavior through this learning process. The learning process may not be a one-time activity, but a long chain of decisions and trials on the way. People do not change their decisions overnight, but they do respond at some point in time. Those affectations dimensions might he very different. Some might be short-term, some things people change overnight, but some of them are long-term, to change my workplace because of growing congestion problems would be a long-term problem. If eventually my job becomes very difficult to reach, it might need this solution area it is tempting to think that basically a process of adaptation to get to a stable solution can be interpreted or approached behaviorally. Some research work in the stretch and successfully. We have to be careful because simple direct analogy does not really work here. The biggest difference between adaptation and learning and adaptation -- adaptation, in the equilibrium schema, what is changing between the [indiscernible - heavy accent] the way how people make decisions and the choice that's and their considerations are largely the same and stable, it is just a different tab will time 
>> They have to take into account that it is an extension of the [indiscernible - heavy accent] people really learn about new options, they go to a different shop which we did did not know before because the existing ones become difficult to reach or for some other reason. Learning and adaptation process is much more complicated. We might see five or 10 years from now some more movement in this direction 
>> Eventually, let's reach back to our bread-and-butter. We will not be using top-level behavioral terminology, what we do want to reach a certain level of convergence. We want to have travel models as outlined in the first part of the webinar that are internally consistent. The travel demand is consistent with the level of service and vice versa. Convergence is necessary in practice as well. If you have a non-convergent model, regardless of the sophistication of the model and advances that you may have on the structural side, this model will never be able to be used. If you run this model several times, you will get very different results each time that you run it and you will have to arbitrarily decide where you stop and if you change the decision, you will accept a different outcome area not convergent models cannot used because the essence is to have repeatable stable results that would allow us for evaluation [indiscernible - heavy accent] in a consistent way or a form level playing ground. If we have a non-convergent model, most frequently the differences [indiscernible - heavy accent] measure of quality 
>> It is absolutely necessary and it makes sense to sacrifice can't make a simpler model to achieve convergence. The convergence relates to the network and to the entire system that includes variable demand as well. System convergence is predicated on network convergence because if you cannot solve the first problem, you cannot ever solve the second problem 
>> There are many challenges associated with convergence. We will not go into a mathematical debate, but I would make you -- like to give you some basics. Not every equilibrium Dema [indiscernible - heavy accent] if you do not do it in the right way, and if you do not do it efficiently, a complicated process will result with [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> It is an interesting mathematical question, does it really converged, is there really a single, stable solution ?  the first is existence. For most of the models, practically we observe unique and stable solutions, but to prove it theoretically is a challenge that can only be done for very simple model. Another issue is non-uniqueness. We might have a model that converges in practice, but the solution might not be unique, which means if you start the process in a different way, it would converge, but to a different solution. A model of this type is a non-unique stationery point is even worse than having a non-convergence model because you do not know what to do because you have several solutions and we are making effort to avoid those multiple schema if we can 
>> When we want to solve an integrated demand problem, there are some efficient series distributed -- developed. If we have a construct that includes simplified levels of the four step model, in some cases we can prove convergence and we can construct a very efficient algorithm to reach this convergence. Specifically, academics have worked intensely in this field and show how these models can be constructed. However, with all due respect to the theory, and those people themselves, it is very fragile. In practice we want more serious demand models, which is when we have those details and convergence becomes problematic [indiscernible - heavy accent] with activity based models, is difficult mathematically to prove how the convergent solution can be achieved. We have to go through a set of tasks and apply [indiscernible - heavy accent], but we have made a lot of progress in this direction and there are some new interesting approaches and paradigms are on the way 
>> In terms of how we can achieve convergence with the more obligated model, a lot of good examples and practice. These have been published and reported including different ways to warm the model system, not to start stupidly from a solution that would require non-convergence. How we can average out the model including trip tables, links volumes and other components to achieve the solution areas how we can suppress Monte Carlo variability by using discretization methods, something we are up -- exploring at the moment [indiscernible - heavy accent] a lot of situations were made and how we can build an incremental process with certain samples of population. Some other parts of the system are frozen this kind of na&ï;ve microsimulation has been abandoned, but a combination of all these methods [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> If you think about this particular schema, for those of you [indiscernible - heavy accent] you can consider the entire activity of the model as just a different and more advanced, sophisticated way to produce eventually a set of mode and try -- trip tables. Now the rest actually become similar to the way how you would tackle equilibria being -- equilibrium with the force of model. Specifically, for use convention of static assignment. When volumes, link times, OD skims that are fed back to the model. It becomes actually familiar schema that you have to resolve it with the four step model as well. What we found is at any point in this process, links volumes, link times, or origin destination schemes, we can average them and there are certain advantages and disadvantages to averaging at this level. Eventually, there is no constraint to average several components within one group, for example, the New York model, which is a very big model with a large number of traffic sounds. The New York model must be run when the average trip tables and links volumes [indiscernible - heavy accent] it gets a stable result 
>> We have stopping criteria. For very single -- simple models, stopping criteria basically can be [indiscernible - heavy accent] because there is a single solution. We can achieve any level of convergence we want and if there is no run-time consideration [indiscernible - heavy accent] when we talk about activity based models combined with static traffic assignments, getting it completely stable is unrealistic so we have to think more realistically about the levels of [indiscernible - heavy accent] what is something we can tolerate ?  normally looks like a certain percentage of links volumes, not more than 5% or some demand component, not more than 10% and for each particular model we explore runtimes and eventually configure all the convergence protocol, but it can be done
>> We have also come up with differential strategy practice, depending on the type of the project. The convergent protocol might be different. It might not be a good idea to have a single way of finding the model, it might be more simple if you automate everything, but not the most efficient way, it is said -- better to adjust the [indiscernible - heavy accent] to the actual nature of the project. Particularly for large-scale models, we came up with a differentiation between cold, warm, hot 
>> Cold start is -- normally requires 9 to 10 iterations. It does not really matter how you start because you have enough iterations so any reasonable start can be done and we do not use any prior outcomes of this model, we normally run models for selected basin area was when you really have completely different [indiscernible - heavy accent] you want to run this model from scratch not using any prior outcomes using a stable solution for the year. [indiscernible - heavy accent] most frequently, if you have generated a stable scenario, you can use a warm strategy. You see out come of the base strategy assuming it is not dramatically different. 
>> A hot start is good enough with one iteration only because FTA does not want to consider benefits as part of the [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> There is a lot of ongoing research where activity based models and dynamic traffic assignments integrate, which is considered the most promisingly way to develop travel demand models for the future
>> All of these examples of how activity based models and dynamic traffic assignments can be better integrated 
>> Many of you know, the dynamic traffic assignment has a lot of advantages, specifically capturing time varying network and demand attractions in a more realistic way. It incorporates traffic components such as signal coordination, queuing, outside the frame of traffic assignments, that can be incorporated in a dynamic traffic assignment. Corder level and [indiscernible - heavy accent] to demonstrate viability as well 
>> And dynamic network assignments algorithms do not use vehicle ratios, they just -- use ways to describe traffic physics. They enforce [indiscernible - heavy accent] in a more realistic way. You can squeeze more cars onto the network segment than the capacity of the [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is built into static traffic assignments 
>> To produce a very long queue or gridlock you can't end of the simulation [indiscernible - heavy accent] it also has a lot of other advantages, but it is a more complicated tool and the fixed a man is not a simple way to [indiscernible - heavy accent] we are not trying to get a new level of [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> This integration is probably a combination point because as we've said many times, this is what we see as the model for the future. Eventually, I believe that in five years these paradigm will be the prevailing practice. We need more advance on the network simulations side, each might come naturally with better computers inside years -- in five years 
>> The two models are just like a marriage made in heaven, both models are [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is very nature will do think that they could work together in the main model -- demand model 
>> [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> The dynamic traffic model would have network [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is a very fine level of resolution and there are examples to achieve all of this 
>> There are issues that we are making right now to make all this happen. It is a marriage made in heaven, but some would have to be organized, it doesn't really work that automatically. This is a good illustration to compare activity based models in the context. With the four step model and static assignment, it is almost like a mathematical fluke. Both arrows and both objects that we have to move from object -- model to model happen to be from the same mathematical structure. The static assignment produces a level of service schemes in exactly the same format which basically gives us a tool of service variables, exactly what we need for this or step demand model. We are very fortunate, we understand that both models are greatly status -- simplified in terms of 
>> There ideally mentioned each other 
>> When we first thought about integration of DTA and ABM , some people thought it would go automatically at the individual level, but it proved to be certain problem that generated a lot of research to explore a different way to solve the problem. One way from the microsimulation toward DTA where we did have a 90 ligature which requires only minor adjustments to happen. This model generates a list of trips, they are not in the format that DTA expects. What DTA -- with minor effort, we can basically lineup this particular and it has already been done. However, the question is what can we feed back to the microsimulation ?  the problem is that the DTA would produce individual trajectories. What we can do with level of service estimates, next time around the same person might have a different destination. If we get back with the four step model, we literally have covered all possible trips, we cannot do it with the same level of resolution here 
>> Some additional things have to be brought up. If we just think about microsimulation [indiscernible - heavy accent] you can integrate those tomorrow at the individual level, but we really cannot. Mathematically you cannot, you have to do something else to support the level of service available -- variables 
>> One of the possible solutions is to replace individual trajectories with aggregate level of service games. -- Schemes. This particular component of the model system becomes close to the four step model. It is something we would like to improve 
>> There are several suggested alternatives that are currently being explored in the frame of ongoing research progress -- projects. We explore to level schemes where there is an additional group of [indiscernible - heavy accent], temp oral equilibrium to achieve individual schedule consistency, it assumes that all trips are fixed, you change them only to go to the outer loop. Things are calibrated so we can take into account and capitalize on the actual individual directories -- trajectories and we can try to achieve full level of consistency between the two models. There is a second level where we want to calibrate other [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> This research direction gave rise to a completely new idea, new dimension for calibration, individual schedule consistency, something you would not normally think about if [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is part of the microsimulation model because we can track each and every individual through the entire day and we have [indiscernible - heavy accent] activity zero is at home and the last activity is also at home. In reality, the activities and trips alternate naturally in such a way that the schedule has gaps and overlaps. Every person can either be an activity location or at travel, only one place at a time. In reality, this is perfectly calibrated for each individual, the schedule does not have any gaps or overlaps 
>> This is an attempt to mimic [indiscernible - heavy accent], something that we do not achieve with the calibration scheme. It does not really sure that the travel time [indiscernible - heavy accent] it gives interesting additional dimension 
>> Here is an example of how it can be handled 
>> If a person had a plan for a day, like any of us, which was a combination of certain trips and reality proved to be not exactly as planned 
>> A trip might be a half an hour longer because of the traffic jam. In reality, people make decisions. There were some interesting publications on how does the schedule process can be realistically implemented [indiscernible - heavy accent] we are currently trying to incorporate [indiscernible - heavy accent] that shows how people adjust their schedule based on their scheduling priorities. 
>> It was extended schedule adjustments that includes different components of duration, departure time, rival time. -- Arrival 
>> This is a very simple, efficient model 
>> The decisions are driven by the behavior wait. Basically, every activity has a certain duration, and the part you time and arrive her time priority. For low income people, it is very important for them to be on time at work, they do not have the flexibility to be five minutes late. There is a high penalty for being late. Those people respond to conditions such as department -- the parting early from home [indiscernible - heavy accent] different conventions and that allows us to structure schedules [indiscernible - heavy accent] very efficiently in a realistic way 
>> Another interesting idea is to pre-sample trip destinations, which gets back to the general idea of learning and adaptation. One of the biggest challenges with activity based models combined dynamic assignments and destination choice [indiscernible - heavy accent]
>> One of the ways to tackle this is pre-sampling assuming that every person has a certain fact -- that, special mental map, which is normally closer to home [indiscernible - heavy accent] if we limited this way, it opens a constructive way for efficient accommodation of individual trajectories. There is a chance that when we calibrate, a person might go to the same place several times and the actual trajectory [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> When they go to the outer loop, I used in a circle -- certain way of priority, the first way is to use individual trajectories. If you do not have an individual trajectory, then we might use individual trajectory for the same part chert time -- departure time. That is what the driver can hear him other people through social networks. If not, we would use aggregate OD schemes, which would be advice from a navigation device, not based on your personal experience 
>> There is some other small details that we need to improve on the demand side to ensure that the demand model pursues his -- produces [indiscernible - heavy accent] one of them is Transocean -- translation of personal tapes into vehicle tapes. It breaks trips into occupants for HOV, but also for all carpools identifies the driver versus the passenger role. Now we can really say who was the driver of the car and form this carpool and assign certain people and it affects the April time and allows us to prepare the input exactly in the format that we need 
>> The same in terms of closing the gap between the demand model and the -- model in terms of temp oral resolution. Moving toward an even smaller level of resolution. We are collaborating with Arizona State University to apply multiple discrete continuous approach is -- approaches 
>> No more random sharpening of trips will be needed. The activity base model will be what the dynamic traffic pattern needs 
>> There are some interesting research. We practitioners [indiscernible - heavy accent] I cannot judge to say whether it is realistic or not, but there may be different approaches, one of them is a integration of activity based model and dynamic traffic assignment [indiscernible - heavy accent] the integration approaches, people would integrate their [indiscernible - heavy accent] and would have feedback which may affect some further decisions. The schedule decision of an activity-based model and the simulation of dynamic traffic assignment are not disconnected [indiscernible - heavy accent] but really one simultaneous process where people are just everything like in real life, you have your first plan, you go to implement it, if this is different than your expected travel time, you change your agenda, you do not wait for the [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> We have been talking OC about the hybrid side of network simulation. What about transit ?  it is equally important. Some significant profit -- progress has been made to basically build a dynamic traffic assignment based on the same principle of real-time microsimulation.
>> University of Arizona is working on a very interesting detail transit assignment 
>> There are some very interesting research in this direction 
>> I believe that in several years there will be dynamic transit assignment on the market and it will be a welcome component 
>> Let me summarize where we stand. It was a long session and maybe not easy to follow, but I would like to summarize 
>> There are many repetitions on the call who want to see the bottom line -- practitioners 
>> Here is the summary and advice 
>> In general there is consensus that integration of [indiscernible - heavy accent] with network models is the way to go in the future and in the near future as well as long-term because it improves sensitivity to all [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is essential because it improves almost all [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> It really makes everything much more reliable in terms of confidence in what we're doing compared to simplified models based on very strong assumptions. It is essential for investment and policy alternatives. It is more realistic representation of changes in network performances by time of day 
>> Specifically, dynamic traffic assignment has some very strong advantages in terms of consistency at the individual level and performance measure -- expanded set of performance measures 
>> There are certain costs of network integrated ABM 
>> The data and the runtime part two things to consider. We need more detailed input. When you have drawbacks or inconsistencies in the network [indiscernible - heavy accent] and we need better validation and -- to settle this. There are runtime implications because some parts of the system [indiscernible - heavy accent] to resolve most of the issues. Specifically, if we talk about dynamic traffic assignment, the biggest breakthrough is when we can think by regions, when it becomes [indiscernible - heavy accent] it is probably -- we are probably not get there, but we are getting close. Examples like San Francisco [indiscernible - heavy accent] area of 1 million people, we need one more step to handle bigger areas, 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 people and that I expect a breakthrough, in about five years or even less. Is important right now, whenever we try to do it, we will be one of the first, if we do not do anything come in five years we might be one of the last, not applying this model 
>> Thank you for your attention and I will be glad to take any questions 
>> Thank you, Peter for that interesting presentation. We do have several questions for both of the presenters. Before we get into that, we have an evaluation of seven questions that you can go through quickly. We would greatly appreciate your participation in this evaluation. They use the information to judge the effectiveness of this webinar and also to plan for teacher webinar is and get a better idea of what works and what does not work. Please take a minute or two right now to fill this out. 
>> What you are doing that, we will start with questions and answers 
>> Our first question is going to our first speaker, Joe. It is referring back to slides 32 and 33. We have a depiction of a four step trip this model -- based and a generic activity-based model. The question is is it because we are working with travel behavior of individuals in synthetic population that the feedback can occur to any of these model steps ? 
>> Thanks for the question. No, I would not say it is working with a synthetic population. For those who did not attend earlier webinar is, what of the important inputs into aggregate activity base models, you could incorporate accessibility measures in the traditional trip-based model that went all the way back to auto ownership. The slide shows that there are generally more components in activity-based and by virtue of that, it looked like it was a lot of feedback. There is a conscious attempt to ensure upward and downward consistency in the models by incorporated feedback in all those places. There is not anything interesting about the synthetic population that allows you to do feedback to hire model systems. -- Higher 
>> Models like higher ownership may be applied at the individual level, you can incorporate much more easily a lot of household specific attributes that may be related to trip -- 
>> Thank you, Joe 
>> Peter, here is a question for you. Earlier you were talking about the dangers of models that do not converge. One of our web viewers wants to know if you could mention some specific model specifications that might help a non-converging model to converge ? 
>> 
>> Peter ? 
>> I am sorry. Can you hear me now ? 
>> I heard the question 
>> Is a very good question. Step number one, there are methods to analyze entire model systems. There are certain components specifically traffic assignment is health that we have very good strategies and normally they converge. What might be a source of [indiscernible - heavy accent] is either attempt to make regeneration or data activity more sensitive, time of day choice and destination choice due to a large number of [indiscernible - heavy accent] the first step is to understand what is the source of non-convergence ?  the second thing is one of the best ways to be -- deal with it is to apply differential averaging strategy. In reality, people botanically use a simple [indiscernible - heavy accent] or just some na&ï;ve [indiscernible - heavy accent] 
>> Actually, depending on the diagnostic and actual state of your convergence, those activity might be -- it can be mathematically calculated and sometimes it can be done in the record. -- MP or click 
>> MP . we 
>> Step number one [indiscernible - heavy accent] I would not go into more deeper analysis which can be implement it also. Normally if you observe wild behavior, it might also be an indication that one of your models just need some [indiscernible - heavy accent] it may be more sensitive. This is something that I cannot really go into 
>> Thank you, Peter 
>> Here is another question. Could one assume that demand and supply go hand-in-hand, are there circumstances when one converges and the other does not ? 
>> 
>> It is a good question. My response is noncommittal in the sense that I think it is dependent on the nature of the assignment methodology that is being employed, the nature of the activity and model and methodology that is being used and how the tools are being interacting. If you were to think about the assignment side, if we have a traditional static equilibrium at 9 AM and we are exposing that process to the exact same demand matrix which would represent converged OD trips. You should, get a convergence with the associated link volumes in times using that particular scheme. Using schemes that are rapidly getting more like BTA methodology, then it becomes a little more complicated than you may find that due to the nature of those models and those simulations that you do not see the same kind of convergence. Here alluded to this, you -- it are -- Peter alluded to this, on the assignment side, on the activity base model side, we talked about this simulation variation due to the Monte Carlo limitation. Peter described how there are different methodologies even within the activity-based model software, the ability to pull sequences which has the effect of two expose the activity made -- based demand model to the same set of schemes, you will produce the same traits that are generated and that is a function of the structure of that. It is all depended on exactly how you configure it, you could expose the activity base model to those same -- configure the model and use the control in another way. There is another question of interacting. We didn't get into all the details of different ways of configuring that interaction, but those would be material to the question of getting convergence to go hand-in-hand 
>> You would think that those who go hand-in-hand, but that is not also to say that there are not lots of instances where depending on the nature of the model we find exceptions to that 
>> Thank you, Joe 
>> We have time for one more question. This is a two-part question for Peter. Peter, this gets at the notion of using DTA rather than static assignment and what we do if we are not using the C. ratios, could they be During static assignments. If not, if we are going to do away with B./C. ratios, what criteria do we use to establish service ? 
>> Basically, we need to understand static assignments and the oversea -- the/C. 
>> [indiscernible - heavy accent] and some other things applied in the DTA framework. There have been many publication showing very substantial differences. The ratio, applied in a simplified way, cannot really produce reasonable time estimate [indiscernible - heavy accent] in my experience, when we oversea becomes greater than one over three, we are dealing with a physical situation and any estimate of travel time that comes out of it, it goes in the right direction, but what comes out of it is extreme [indiscernible - heavy accent] and it has nothing to do with reality. This mechanism in DTA is replaced with simulation. Different things would start happening, gridlock, vehicles would be waiting for the -- [indiscernible - heavy accent] there have been ultimo publication showing that the DTA wave of simulating travel times is much closer to reality than he oversea [indiscernible - heavy accent] especially when it comes to extreme levels of congestion. It can produce hundreds of minutes of [indiscernible - heavy accent] and we do not observe it in reality, but in some other situations, it is not a good way to estimate the effects of the traffic flow 
>> Something like simplified method of doing something. I have been over this for many years and I will be sincere with you, whenever you try to create a war realistic estimate of travel times, [indiscernible - heavy accent] used on the oversea ratio and other functions to get traffic volumes right and then recalculate [indiscernible - heavy accent] more realistic travels times 
>> Eventually, it did not work. It might work in a particular situation, but the general approach is not the way to go. The right way to go is to have a tool like DTA that literally follows the physics of the traffic. The other is not the way vehicles behave on the highway. You might make it look better in some situations, it will probably fall apart I could did in my case and some other places. We need a new approach, but I do understand that you may need to use Highway assignment so we can talk about [indiscernible - heavy accent] to still use it in practice. In this case, I do not believe in capping [indiscernible - heavy accent] we have some better procedures where travel times produce static assignment based on the actual time surveys to have a better estimate. It is a temporary solution. My suggestion is to take [indiscernible - heavy accent] this is the way to go 
>> Thank you Peter. Unfortunately, we are out of time. We went over time because we have a lot of intellectually stimulating material and some good questions. I would let this bank -- bank out I would like to thank our speakers and our audience. We have our final webinar on September 20, that will be the final one on forecasting performance measures and software 
>> Thank you, everyone
