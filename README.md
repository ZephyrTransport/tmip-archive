This repository contains the old TMIP mailing list archive, attachments, and links to webinars and
tools from the now-defunct FTA TMIP website.

This is a VueJS client-side web app that will be merged into the main Zephyr website when it is
complete.

The attachment files themselves will remain in this repo instead of being merged into the Zephyr website in
order to keep the website code size small.
